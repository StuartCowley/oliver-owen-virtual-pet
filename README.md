# Description
This is my virtual pet project, where I will be using Javascript to create a pet capable of eating, growing and dying.

## Setting Up
Setting up -
Create a directory - virtual-pet
``` npm init```
Initialize npm in the command line, leading to set up of package.json.
We then install our testing package - Jest.
```npm install -D jest```
We then change our 'test' in our package.json to 'jest'.
 ```touch pet.js
 touch pet.test.js
 ```
