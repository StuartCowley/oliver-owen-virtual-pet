# Description
This is my virtual pet project, where I will be using Javascript to create a pet capable of eating, growing and dying.

## Setting Up
Setting up -

Create a directory - virtual-pet

```npm init```

Initialize npm in the command line, leading to set up of package.json.

We then install our testing package - Jest.

```npm install -D jest```

We then change our 'test' in our package.json to 'jest'.

 ```
 touch pet.js
 touch pet.test.js
 ```

 We create our main pet.js file and the testing file, pet.test.js.

 ```touch .gitignore```
 
 Lastly, we create the .gitignore file. In this file we write ```node_modules/``` to ensure we don't push the large amount of files.
